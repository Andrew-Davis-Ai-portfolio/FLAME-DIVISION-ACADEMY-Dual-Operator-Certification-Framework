FLAME DIVISION ACADEMY

Dual Operator Certification Framework

Status: FOUNDATION — DO NOT DILUTE · DO NOT EDIT · DO NOT SKIP

⸻

I. PURPOSE (WHY THIS EXISTS)

Flame Division Academy certifications exist to determine who is trusted to operate real systems.

This is not education for awareness.
This is accreditation for responsibility.

Primary question answered by every certificate:
“Can this person be trusted to design, deploy, and explain systems without supervision?”

⸻

II. CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These principles override curriculum, tooling, and technology changes.
	1.	Certification = License
	•	A certificate grants permission to operate
	•	It is not decorative
	•	It is revocable
	2.	Human-in-the-Loop Authority
	•	AI assists learning
	•	AI never authorizes certification
	•	All certifications require human review
	3.	Evidence over Performance
	•	Speed is not rewarded
	•	Clarity, reasoning, and traceability are required
	•	Final output must be explainable
	4.	Audit Trail Required
Every attempt must retain:
	•	Prompt history
	•	Build evidence
	•	Reflection
	•	Instructor decision
	5.	Ethics Is Structural
	•	Ethics are not motivational
	•	Ethics are operational constraints
	•	Unsafe operators do not pass

III. CERTIFICATION STRUCTURE (DUAL TRACK)

No single-track operators exist beyond Phase 1.

🟦 AWO — AWS Workflow Operator

🟥 KWO — Kubernetes Workflow Operator

✅ Dual Operator Certification requires BOTH.

⸻

IV. TRACK A — AWS WORKFLOW OPERATOR (AWO)

Scope of Authority

Certified AWO holders may:
	•	Design AWS-based workflows
	•	Explain IAM boundaries and responsibility
	•	Reason about cost, scale, and failure
	•	Participate in production infrastructure discussions

They may not:
	•	Act unsupervised without certification
	•	Delegate responsibility they cannot explain
	•	Obscure risk behind tools

⸻

AWO LEVELS

AWO-1: System Reasoning
Assessment:
	•	Explain IAM, VPCs, and permissions in plain language
	•	Identify blast radius of misconfiguration
	•	Describe ethical response to improper access

✅ Pass/Fail only.

⸻

AWO-2: Workflow Design
Assessment:
	•	Design a production workflow
	•	Write a structured prompt to generate architecture
	•	Justify tradeoffs clearly

✅ Pass requires reasoning, not diagrams alone.

⸻

AWO-3: Incident Simulation
Assessment:
	•	Respond to outage, permission leak, or billing anomaly
	•	Write calm step-by-step response
	•	Document prevention strategy

✅ Certification granted only after review.

⸻

V. TRACK B — KUBERNETES WORKFLOW OPERATOR (KWO)

Scope of Authority

Certified KWO holders may:
	•	Design Kubernetes workflows
	•	Explain cluster behavior
	•	Diagnose failures logically
	•	Justify YAML configuration intent

They may not:
	•	Apply manifests they cannot explain
	•	Treat Kubernetes as “just tooling”

⸻

KWO LEVELS

KWO-1: Mental Model
Assessment:
	•	Explain cluster logic
	•	Describe deployment vs pod vs service
	•	Identify failure risks in misconfiguration

⸻

KWO-2: Workflow Construction
Assessment:
	•	Define intent first, YAML second
	•	Explain health checks and rollout logic
	•	Demonstrate understanding of scaling

⸻

KWO-3: Failure Drill
Assessment:
	•	Diagnose crash loops, bad rollouts, and miswired services
	•	Write post-mortem report
	•	Propose safeguards

⸻

VI. FINAL SYNTHESIS — DUAL OPERATOR EXAM

Required to pass BOTH tracks.

Candidate must:
	•	Explain an AWS + Kubernetes system end-to-end
	•	Identify failure points
	•	Justify design decisions
	•	Describe ethical boundaries

✅ Output:
	•	Written system brief
	•	Prompt log
	•	Reflection
	•	Instructor sign-off

⸻

VII. CERTIFICATION ISSUANCE

Certificates are:
	•	Issued manually
	•	Logged with unique ID
	•	Time-stamped
	•	Revocable

Issued titles:
	•	Certified AWS Workflow Operator
	•	Certified Kubernetes Workflow Operator
	•	Certified Cloud Systems Operator (Dual)

⸻

VIII. REVOCATION & GOVERNANCE

Certification may be revoked if:
	•	Misrepresentation occurs
	•	Unsafe practices are demonstrated
	•	Ethics violations are identified

No appeals without new evidence.

IX. VERSION LOCK

This document is FOUNDATIONAL.

Future curriculum may expand.
This authority model does not.
